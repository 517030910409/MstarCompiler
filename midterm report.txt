it's very happy to rebuild my code again and again to make it nicer, though it's a lot of work.
it's very unhappy to debug with failed testcases, to make the structure become more and more ugly, and i doubt if the structure still work in further coding phase very much.
i gain much about java coding and understand better with OO coding during the process.
as the process goes on, it must be harder for not only the difficulty on project, but also uglier structure. i'm very worried about that.
